# mint-notag

This is my fork of mint with the following changes from upstream:

- Removed `[MODDED]` prefix from public lobby name
- Renamed program to `mint-notag` from `DRG Mod Integration`
  - Logs and config paths will still use the old name
- Added <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd> keyboard shortcut to quit the program
- Improved buttons descriptions and messages
- Added an icon to the Windows executable
- Update modal will show without delays
- Increased initial window size
- Shortened approval labels

For more information on mint usage see the [original README](https://github.com/trumank/mint?tab=readme-ov-file).
